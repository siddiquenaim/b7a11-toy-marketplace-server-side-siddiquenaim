# Toy Marketplace Server-side

## About This Project

The Toy Marketplace Server-side is the back-end component of the Toy Marketplace project, responsible for handling API requests and interacting with the database. This component is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and deployed on a cloud hosting platform. Here are some key points about this project:

- API Endpoints: The server-side provides various API endpoints for fetching toy data, adding new toys, updating toy information, and more.
- Database Integration: The application integrates with MongoDB as the database for storing and retrieving toy data.
- RESTful Architecture: The server-side follows a RESTful architecture to provide a consistent and structured approach for handling API requests and responses.
- Middleware: The server-side utilizes middleware such as CORS and JSON parsing to enhance security and handle request data appropriately.
- Deployment: The server-side is deployed on a cloud hosting platform, ensuring the availability of the API endpoints for the client-side application.

This project aims to provide a robust and scalable back-end infrastructure for the Toy Marketplace application, enabling efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
